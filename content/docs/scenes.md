A scene is a single screen of your game, it can contain multiple [actors](/docs/actors) and [triggers](/docs/triggers). Your game will typically be made up of many scenes connected together with triggers using the _Switch Scene_ event.

## Adding a Scene

To add a scene to a scene click the _**+** button_ in the _Editor Tools_ and select _Scene_ from the menu (alternatively press the **S** key), then click on any empty space in the _Project Viewport_ where you wish to place the scene.

<img src="/img/screenshots/add-scene.gif" style="width:300px"/>

When a scene has been added you can use the _Editor Sidebar_ to give the scene a name and to choose which background image from your project's assets that you want to use. See the documentation for [Backgrounds](/docs/backgrounds) for more information on adding background images.

## Scripting

A scene script can be used to have events run as soon as the scene is loaded. When the scene is selected click the _Add Event button_ in the _Editor Sidebar_ to open the event menu and start building the script. For more information see the documentation for [Scripting](/docs/scripting).
