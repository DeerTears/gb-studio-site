## How to create color-ready graphics
- Ensure [Backgrounds](/docs/backgrounds) use 4-color greenscale just like non-color graphics
- Ensure [Sprites](/docs/sprites) use 3-color greenscale with #65FF00 for transparency just like non-color graphics

In order to map a GB graphic to a new palette, all assets have to use the default GB palette. GB Studio can remaps the green GB colors to the palette of your choosing.

This also means that games can use one sprite with different palette settings to save on sprite frames in a scene.
