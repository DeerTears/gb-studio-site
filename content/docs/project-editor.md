The default view for the _Project Editor_, as shown below, is the _Game World_. This is where you can create your game by combining scenes, adding actors and triggers then building scripting events to add interactions.

Use the _Editor Tools_ to switch between Select, Add, Erase and Collision Drawing modes.

In the _Select mode_ clicking scenes, actors or triggers causes the _Editor Sidebar_ to show editable fields specific to whatever was selected. Clicking in the background between scenes switches the sidebar back to the _Project Editor_ where you can set the project name and choose the starting scene and position.

## The Asset Viewer

Using the _Project Navigator_ you can switch between the available views for your project. If you select _Sprites_, _Backgrounds_, _UI Elements_ or _Music_ you will be taken to the asset viewer where you can search and preview the assets available in your game.
